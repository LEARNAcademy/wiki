**SASS**

----------

In their own words, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.

There is an online editor for you to be able to practice working in [Sass](http://sassmeister.com/)

The [Sass documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html) and they also have basics of what you need know when working in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
