**What is JumpStart**
----------------

From zero to programming in 24 hours of coding
LEARN jumpstart is an introduction to modern web development boiled down to a single weekend. We’ll cover the basics of programming, the tools involved and really help you understand if software development is something you can be passionate about.

We work together for two and a half days on the following:

- Software Fundamentals

From loops to arrays, we'll go over the basic building blocks of writing code. We will practice getting our heads around how these fundamentals fit together.

- Pair Programming and other Problem Solving Techniques

You’ll work in pairs and small groups, practice complex problem solving and become acquainted with reading documentation and other resources. We won’t just give you problems to solve, we’ll teach you how to solve any number of problems you face in the future.

- HTML and CSS

The fundamental building blocks of delivering content via the web. HTML is what you want to say, and CSS is how you want it to look.

- Javascript

All the action that takes place in a web browser is written in Javascript. There is no interaction with the user after the page loads without it, and thus Javascript is a key part of any web development stack.

- Development Tools

Begin to get comfortable with the tools developers use. LEARN how to look behind the scenes to discover what's happening in your browser every day. Text editors, debuggers and consoles, oh my!

**Try LEARN On for Size**

Code bootcamps are a huge commitment. Try out whether this programming thing is really for you, without having to commit more than a weekend. And if it turns out not to be your passion, walk away knowing something about how web sites are really working.

It's also the perfect way to prep for starting the LEARN Bootcamp and all enrollment dues go toward the fees for our full time bootcamp if you decide to enroll in one.
