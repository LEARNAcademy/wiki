In order to keep the programming momentum going here are some opportunities available to keep learning web development and for continued integration in the SD Tech Community!

### LEARN Academy Full-Time Bootcamp

The LEARN Bootcamp is a collaborative and immersive, four month, full-time (9am-5pm), coding bootcamp that teaches adults the skills they need to start a career in web development. The final month of the course is an internship with a local San Diego company. Students enter the workforce with several portfolio pieces and real world experience on their resume.
