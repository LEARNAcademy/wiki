**Whiteboard Questions**

-------------------------

**Whiteboarding** is when you are asked to sketch out a visual and/or pseudo-code solution to a problem, and talking out loud about your thought process as you go.

Here are some sample questions for you to practice whiteboarding:

- Write a function that computes the factorial of a number. Do this with and without recursion.

- Say you have an application with users. How would you let them have followers?

- Design a database schema for an e-commerce site, so that users can buy items that are stocked on the site.

- Write a method to determine if a number is a prime.

- Design a database schema to keep track of scores of games for a basketball league.

- Make a web page with a button. When you click that button, it should create another button with all of the same behavior - i.e., clicking it should create another button.
