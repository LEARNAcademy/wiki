**Presentation Ideas**

----------------------

During class time, we encourage our students to present for 10 minutes about a technology that they enjoy using or have just learned about. We do this because speaking at meet ups is an excellent way to become know within the community. Practicing this skill in front of friendly faces in class is a great way of becoming more proficient at public speaking.

Below are some inspirations for future talks from past presentations and other ideas for future talks.

**Ideas from Articles or TED Talks**

---------------------

Reading articles and watching interesting lectures is a great basis for a tech talk.

For instance, one student was inspired to give a talk after watching a TED talk about how [**CAPTCHA**](https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration?language=en) had helped digitize books and that now Luis von Ahn's ambitious new project, **Duolingo**, was going to help millions learn a new language while translating the Web quickly and accurately and for free.

Another student read an article on how a company called [**FreeVolt**](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/30/freevolt-free-energy/) had developed what they claim to be the first commercially available technology that powers devices using ambient RF energy.

**Ideas from Class**

---------------------

Some students were inspired to talk about areas covered in the curriculum.
These students saw the tech talk as an opportunity to dig deeper in subjects that they either want to know more about or felt they needed to spend more time on to feel like that understood it better.
They spoke about how to work collaboratively on **Github**, gave an introduction to technologies such as **Node.js** and **Sass**, highlighted some useful and important **Ruby Gems** and Technologies in the Workplace.

**Passion Projects**

------------------

Some of our students came to us already with areas of expertise that they wanted to share.
We have had tech talks about how the **RaspberryPi** works, musical demonstrations on **SonicPi**, how to create, build and market a mobile phone app, the importance of teaching code in our schools, and even Plant Grafting.
