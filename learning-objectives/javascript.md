JAVASCRIPT

- Do input with **prompt()** and output with **console.log()** and **alert()**
- Write clear and concise if-statements, loops, procedural code, and functions
- Use DOM manipulation techniques to adjust content and styling on the page with Javascript
- Create event-listeners with associated functions to have websites respond to user behavior
- Use JSON to store data, then use that data elsewhere
- Use XHR to fetch information from a remote API, then use that information to display content
