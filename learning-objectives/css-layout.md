CSS LAYOUT

- Use element positioning to determine layout
- Use **float** and **clear** to position block-level elements
- Use the CSS Box Model to adjust how elements display
- Use **z-index** and other tools to position content above/beneath other content
- Given a comp, reproduce that comp with reasonable accuracy
- Create sites that are functional and look nice at a variety of screen widths using media queries
