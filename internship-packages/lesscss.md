**Less**

----------------

In their own words, [Less](http://lesscss.org/) is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.

They have an online editor for you to be able to practice working in [Less](http://lesscss.org/less-preview/)â€¦

This is a pretty good introduction to working with [Less](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/07/learn-less-in-10-minutes-or-less/). It gives you all you need to know with the set up within your app, and the basics regarding variables, nesting, functions and operations. All allegedly in 10 minutes!
