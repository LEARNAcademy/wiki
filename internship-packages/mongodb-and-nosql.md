**MongoDB & NoSQL**

----------------

A [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

[SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/sql-vs-nosql-differences/) has a useful comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases and here from [w3resource](http://www.w3resource.com/mongodb/nosql.php).

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/mongodb-architecture-guide?jmp=search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign={campaign}&utm_keyword=mongodb&utm_device=c&utm_network=g&utm_medium=cpc&utm_creative=112603764163&utm_matchtype=e&gclid=CODJhoulws8CFVA0aQodpyAHdA) is the leading NoSQL database. In their own words, with MongoDB, you can build applications that were never possible with traditional relational databases.

[MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/)'s official site has a full tutorial and there is an pretty in-depth tutorial on MongoDB at [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/).
