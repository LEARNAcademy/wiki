**Elixir**

----------------

In their own words, [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

This is how to [get started](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) from installation to running scripts.

There is a free video introduction to Elixir at [LearnElixir](https://www.learnelixir.tv/episodes/01-introduction), but then you have to pay for the rest of the course.

And there is a step-by-step tutorial on building an application with Elixir at [ElixirDose](http://www.elixirdose.com/)

In addition to this, there is a fairly detailed video introduction on [SolutionStreet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lly-1UYmnFI&list=PLn76XROGFNtE9InImlu6e8isbOsM7qKtt&index=1)'s YouTube channel
