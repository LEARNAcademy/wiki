**Haml**

-----------

In their own words, [Haml]( http://haml.info/about.html) is a markup language thatâ€™s used to cleanly and simply describe the HTML of any web document without the use of inline code. Haml functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as PHP, ASP, and ERB, the templating language used in most Ruby on Rails applications.

They have an online editor for you to be able to practice working in [Haml](http://www.haml-converter.com/)

This is the [Haml](http://haml.info/docs.html) documentation and their own [tutorial](http://haml.info/tutorial.html) about how to get started.

There is a ScreenCast about an Introduction to [Haml](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILt6q_o2hts)
