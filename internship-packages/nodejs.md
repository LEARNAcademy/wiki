**Node.js**

----------------

In their own words, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)'s package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world and is designed to build scalable network applications.

This is a pretty good introduction to working with Node.js from [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js). There is a free introductory level that should ease you in. And this, from [Modulus](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js) also worth checking out.

[Airpair](https://www.airpair.com/javascript/node-js-tutorial) have a nice tutorial to help you get set up and [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/) has a pretty comprehensive guide to working in Node.js.
