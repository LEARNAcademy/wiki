**CoffeeScript**

----------------

In their own words, [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.

Remember that you can work in the online editor, [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) for CoffeeScript. Click on the Languages option on the sidebar, and choose CoffeeScript.
