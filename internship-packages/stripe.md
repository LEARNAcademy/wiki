**Stripe**

----------

In their own words, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is the best way to accept payments online and in mobile apps.

The [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs) will help you get started.

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/integrating-payments-with-the-stripe-api/) has an hour-long tutorial and there is a series of video tutorials starting [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGtyLk2s5-k).

This video tutorial is specific to integrating with Rails with [RackSpace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBZ6fE6By4).
