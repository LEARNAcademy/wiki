**Non-Technical Questions**

Here are some questions to be prepared for in a non-technical interview:

- Why did you get into programming?

- What made you pick LEARN SD?

- Where do you see yourself in the future?

- Tell me about yourself. What's your background?

- What problems do you see with current web development tools?

- What do you like about current web development trends?

- Do you write JavaScript or rely more on libraries like jQuery?

- What frameworks have you used?

- What testing tools have you used?

- Are you familiar with HAML/SASS/Markdown?

- Why do you want to work here?

- What questions do you have for me? (Ask about their practices, tools, and culture - have three or so questions ready for them.)

- What kind of culture do you want in your workplace?

- What are some of the challenges you faced while pairing?

- Give an example of how you resolved a disagreement with your pair.

- Tell me about the intern project you worked on.

Your goal should be to paint yourself as somebody whose life has been preparing you for this moment to become a developer. Talk about any coding you did as a kid or in school, emphasize parts of jobs where you worked with computers or spreadsheets, and tell about coding you did on your own outside of work or school before LEARN SD. You want to show the interviewer your passion for coding, by illustrating how its come up in different ways throughout your life.
