**What to do before class starts**

---------------

You must complete the following before starting at LEARN:

## HTML and CSS

[HTML/CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) Have HTML down. Be able to do tables, know how to make a form and all the field types. Know how to load up a CSS or Javascript file. Know how to insert a Euro symbol or an En Dash into an HTML document. The less time we have to spend on that in class, the more time you can spend learning to program. To help solidify those skills I would also recommend these [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/html-css) and [CodeAvengers](http://www.codeavengers.com/web/1#1.2) exercises.

Once you’ve learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it is tempting to think you have them covered enough for the class. But note that CSS, in particular, is a deep and complex subject. If you have an interest in design, it is also an area that is amenable to spending a few months really working at. Some good design sensibilities along with intermediate CSS skills are just about an employable skill set right there. Even if you’re not a designer at heart, familiarity with CSS will let you fake it efficiently enough to get on with the back end work you really love.

If you have time to do so dig into some CSS lessons, and then start looking at articles on a site like [AListApart](http://alistapart.com).

If you have little experience with programming, the best thing you can do between now and the start of class is to devote yourself to [Khan Academy’s programming class](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). It’s fun, it’s Javascript which is one of our main subject areas, and if you’ve done no programming at all before, programming in general is something that takes a lot of practice to learn, so the more the better.

The computers at LEARN are Macs, so if you're unfamiliar with using a Mac, you should try to get some of the basics down, perhaps by getting some instruction at the Apple Store, or by looking at online Apple Support.

## Typing

Typing quickly is vital to programming. It'll come with time, but let's get started early. The following are some online exercises that will help.  
- [Typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/) is a fun way to practice your typing and keep track of your speed  
- [Typing.io](http://typing.io) is a typing practice to help you get comfortable typing those awkward programming characters  
Make sure that typing at least 30 wpm. You'll be programming in pairs and coding along quite a bit in class, so this is essential. And try to minimize your unproductive keystrokes.

## Terminal

It would also be useful for you to learn basic unix command line tools. You don't need to be an expert — mostly you just need to understand file paths. If you're not already familiar with this subject, take a look at this [introduction to Terminal](http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855) exercise.

## Try Ruby

[Ruby Bits](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits)

If you've already done both of these courses, there's no harm in doing them again. Review the slides. Is there something you think you understand but might not? Google that. Dig deep into these basics so that you can hit the ground running on Day 1.

Check out some of the Elementary and Easy problems at [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/).

## Macs

If you're new to Macs, you should spend some time learning how to use your computer:

Mac for Beginners - A quick look around the basic layout of OSX.
OSX Basics - A video guide to some basic things in OSX.
Using Spotlight - A quick overview of spotlight.
