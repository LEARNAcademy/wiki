Meet the Team!

## CEO and Co-Founder: Chelsea Kaufman

With a background in education, a masters in business administration, and experience in every aspect of the theater - Chelsea is our Jack of All Trades! As you’ve prepared to start at LEARN academy you’ve probably traded countless emails and phone calls with Chelsea, asking her every question you can think of… Keep Doing It! Chelsea is here to listen to whatever is on your mind, so take advantage of it!

## Lead Instructor: Allan Schougaard

Allan is a computer geek to the core - he started on a ZX81/TimexSinclair 1000 clone (how many of us can say that)! He has a masters in Computer Science and Education, and an MBA, making him uniquely qualified to teach at Learn! Before joining us he worked at various tech companies, from startups to Fortune 500.

Allan is your main guide through the next 4 months. He’s there to answer any questions you have, offer further explanations, help you when you are stumped, lead you to go deeper … you get the picture. He is an agilist and a life coach - so don’t ever be shy to ask Allan for help!

## Instructors: Paul Hutchinson, Adam Thayer & Kaitlin Abrahamson

Paul as well as the Student Affairs Coordinator. He graduated from a similar web development bootcamp in Omaha and has twelve years training and experience in education in his native United Kingdom. Paul will meet with each of you once a week to discuss your progress in the course and any issues that come up.

Adam is also a recent bootcamp graduate, in fact he was a star student in LEARN academy’s second class! Adam was a technical writer before deciding to switch careers, and he spent his internship working with the LEARN academy team to update and perfect our curriculum. Now as an instructor, he will continue to be in charge of curriculum development. He should be your go to if you have any feedback on the course itself OR if you’re looking for a surfing buddy!

Kaitlin is a LEARN graduate returning to the team to spread the Rails gospel after spending some time in the San Diego start-up industry.  She is thrilled to be back in the classroom, having taught college students Shakespeare and Beowulf before making her career switch to web development.  She will happily talk your ear off about ActiveRecord, why database design is important, Bon Jovi, or, if you're a video gaming sort of person, all things Tomb Raider.

## Co-Founders and Technical Consultants: Rob Kaufman and Matt Clark

Rob Kaufman and Matt Clark have been using Rails for longer than anyone here, running a successful software consultancy, Notch8, since 2007. They are both extremely active in their local Ruby communities, with Rob being an organizer of SD Ruby for approximately forever. They are some of the smartest guys we know, and they will be helping you every chance they can. Ask them questions on slack (or in person) when you get stuck, go to them to hear about the ‘real world’ of Ruby, and use their connections to insert yourself in the Ruby community!

## Community Outreach Organizer: Dr. Lisa Rosenfelt

Lisa has always been a people person. Before joining the LEARN academy team, she got her Phd in Linguistics and ran off to Paris for 2 years to do research and eat baguettes. Now she is back where her passion lies, connecting LEARN academy and all its students to the community around it. Throughout the course, Lisa will organize events and community outreach opportunities. She is also in charge of the internships, reaching out to companies, setting up interviews, and ultimately finding each student the best match possible.  Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have ideas or input on anything you see her working on! Lisa is also the voice of LEARN academy through social media - so feel free to send her things to post!

## Student Affairs Coordinator: Hillary Whitmore

Hillary is a San Diego native and professional development enthusiast. After graduating from SDSU with a degree in political science, Hillary moved to Seattle and helped to recruit an army of canvassers raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for political non-profits. Since then, Hillary has been carefully expanding her network all over the country so that LEARN graduates can tap into supportive communities across the United States. She is passionate about working with people and helping others to exceed in their professional lives.

## Interim Career Services Coordinator: Will Opperman
