**Computer Set-up**

----------------

It will be useful to do some of the setup before you come. Here are the tools you should install.

[Atom](https://atom.io/)  
The editor we use for the course is Atom: It’s a free and open-source text and source code editor for OS X, Linux, and Windows.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha)  
Google's web browser

If you want to be able to work in Windows, I would also suggest installing [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). But you would be better off installing [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) into a virtual machine, and then installing tools on that.

Later on in the course you will need Postgres and PGAdmin

[Postgres and PGAdmin](https://postgresql.org)  
If you’re using a Mac, an alternative and somewhat easier way to set up Postgres is to download Postgres.app.

At Learn we use the [RailsBridge Installfest](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/), a set of step-by-step instructions for installing Ruby, Rails, and other important tools on Mac, Windows, or Linux computers
