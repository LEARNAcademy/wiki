**Computer Set-up**

----------------

It will be useful to do some of the setup before you come. Here are the tools you should install.

[Atom](https://atom.io/)  
The editor we use for the course is Atom.
It’s a free and open-source text and source code editor for OS X, Linux and Windows.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha)  
Google's web browser and speedy.

If you want to be able to work in Windows, we would also suggest installing [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). But you would be better off installing [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) into a virtual machine, and then installing tools on that.

Later on in the course you will need [Postgres](https://postgresql.org) and [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
If you’re using a Mac, an alternative and somewhat easier way to set up Postgres is to download [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/).

At LEARN, we use the [RailsBridge Installfest](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/), a set of step-by-step instructions for installing Ruby, Rails, and other important tools on Mac, Windows, or Linux computers

In class, LEARN provides stations equipped with Macs. In order to access the curriculum outside of class, you may decide to buy a laptop. It does not have to be brand spanking new.

The requirements for the computer are:

- Mac operating system.
- Capable of running the 10.8 operating system or higher.
- 4 GB of memory.

You can search for used computers on [eBay](http://bit.ly/JO0g0F) and [Apple Store](http://bit.ly/1lEUAm0)

Let us know if you're not sure whether or not a particular product is suitable for the class.
