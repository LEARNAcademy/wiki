**Computer Set-up**

----------------

It will be useful to do some of the setup before you come. Here are the tools you should install.

[Atom](https://atom.io/)  
The editor we use for the course is Atom: It’s a free and open-source text and source code editor for OS X, Linux, and Windows.

[Postgres and PGAdmin](https://postgresql.org) If you’re using a Mac, an alternative and somewhat easier way to set up Postgres is to download Postgres.app. 

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha).

If you want to be able to work in Windows, I would also suggest installing [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). But you would be better off installing [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) into a virtual machine, and then installing tools on that.

[RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is an Integrated Development Environment that acts as an editor like Atom, but also provides intelligent code completion for Ruby and Ruby on Rails code, on-the-fly code analysis and refactoring support for both plain Ruby projects and web applications built with Ruby on Rails, as well as some fancy debugging tools.
The course includes a free license, and you can install it on Mac, Windows or Linux.

Accounts Setup

If you don’t already have them, you should set up accounts on:

LinkedIn Many of you may have an account on LinkedIn already, but it will be time well spent to update your profile to include your new career direction.

StackOverflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers, on a wide range of computer programming topics.

Slack is how we communicate within our group in class and beyond. Here is where you should post questions about your code, interesting articles related to web development and help others out. It might also be nice to sign up early to interact with fellow students before class starts.

Github is a code management and sharing tool will be an important part of our work at LEARN. Before you come to class, please set up a basic account.

Optional: Blogging You might enjoy (or appreciate later) keeping a journal of your preparation and completion of school. Writing down your reflections can also help you gain exposure in the community, which can be useful in various ways.
