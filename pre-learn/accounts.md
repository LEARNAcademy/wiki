**Accounts Setup**

--------------------

If you donâ€™t already have them, you should set up accounts on:

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) Many of you may have an account on LinkedIn already, but it will be time well spent to update your profile to include your new career direction.

[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers, on a wide range of computer programming topics.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is how we communicate within our group in class and beyond. Here is where you should post questions about your code, interesting articles related to web development and help others out. It might also be nice to sign up early to interact with fellow students before class starts.

[Github](https://github.com/) is a code management and sharing tool will be an important part of our work at LEARN. Before you come to class, please set up a basic account.

## Optional: Blogging 
You might enjoy (or appreciate later) keeping a journal of your preparation and completion of school. Writing down your reflections can also help you gain exposure in the community, which can be useful in various ways. We have asked students in past classes to contribute to LEARN academy's own blog which you can read [here](https://www.learnacademy.org/blog). They talk about their motivations for join LEARN and their experiences throughout the course.
