**A Brave Space**
----------------

We, at **LEARN academy**, endeavor to build a brave, inclusive space.
That includes our physical classroom, anywhere we go, and all of our online activity.
Students can be brave because itâ€™s safe.

While everyone connected with **LEARN academy** are expected to make their best effort to be respectful, there is an understanding that someone may say something that results in unintentional offense and hurt feelings for those around. A primary assumption of brave space is that everyone speaks with the positive intent of seeking a greater knowledge and understanding of differing perspectives and experiences. We can recover and learn.
