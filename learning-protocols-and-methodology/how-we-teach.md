**How We Teach**
----------------

**The Alliance**

- We create an alliance with the students. Together we provide everything they need to become successful in their next step.
- Every cohort opens under new management: students + instructors.
- Together we create the experience of learning.
- **Everything we do is in support of learning**

**Community**

Our students...

- join a community, not an institution, where they will form profound bonds and remove barriers

Our instructors...
- participate in happenings, exercises and protocols
- practice what we preach: help protocol
- share themselves, feelings and personal understandings
- lead by example: servant leadership

Together...
- everybody has a voice
- we make room for everyone to speak during fireside chats, check-ins and  one-on-ones
- equal footing between instructors and students: “We are in this together”

**Collaboration**

- One of our core goals is to make our students effective collaborators though pair programming, check-ins, group formation exercises and team project simulations
- This is achieved by giving students the vocabulary to collaborate: check-in script, ask for help script and the pass & check-out scripts

**Our Approach**

- **Everything we do is in support of learning**
- Servant leadership: We are here to serve our students
- We listen to understand, not to respond, that comes later
- We acknowledge people. Whole people with feelings, issues and struggles
