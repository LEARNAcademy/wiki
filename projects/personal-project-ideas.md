Project Ideas
-------------
It is a really good idea to always have a project to work on. It is important for many reasons. One of the most commonly asked questions at interviews is "What are you working on at the moment?". It will reflect well on you if you are sen to working on things in your spare time. This question is also a great way to start a conversation at networking events, regardless of whether you are currently employed or not. If you have a side project running at all times, it allows you to keep your skills sharp and current. It is also a good way to experiment with new or different technologies.

Sometimes it is difficult to come up with ideas for projects to test out your skills. Below is a combination of suggestions from the internet as well as fully fleshed out ideas structured using stories from Agile Development that were almost chosen as group projects in previous classes.

### Suggestions from Previous Classes

#### Park Finder app

A website that will search the area in a selected radius around your location and send back a list of Public Parks with the facilities.

**Roles**:
Registered User

**Stories**:
- As a user, I can go to the website and get a compelling experience of what the website is all about.
- As a user, I want to search for parks around a selected radius of my location.
- As a user, I want to search for parks by different criteria such as: does it have a playground?; does it have a basketball court?; can you have dogs off leash?; does it have a picnic tables?; can you BBQ?; does it have a bathroom?; can you have open containers? etc
- As a user, I want to leave a review of my experience at each park based on safety, quality, cleanliness, amount of fun had etc.
- As a user, I want to post photos to the parks page.

#### Pair Picker app

An app which could be used by LEARN for future cohorts.  The idea would be to streamline the pair picking process, creating new unique random pairs each day, based on those students in attendance.  While this would be a specific application for a specific purpose, we also could see it being used by other coding boot camps and/or businesses who would like to implement pair programming.

**Roles**:
Student: register their info with avatar
Class lead: roll call, create listing of random pairs given the history of random pairs, clear all students, clear single student, clear history (in case of issues), enter non-functional pairs (two people not to be paired), reset pairing when all combinations have been used.

**Stories**:
As an internet user, I can go to landing page so that I can get a compelling experience of what the website is all about.
As a student, I can register based on my email address, so I can be paired.
As a student, I can register with my Facebook account, so I can be paired.
As a logged in student, I can change my personal information.
As a logged in student, I can delete myself from the system.
As a logged in student, I can see my pairing history.
As a logged in student, I can see the history of all the random pairs I have created.


As an admin, I can make a class lead have the class lead role.
As an admin, I can remove a student from the system, so that they don’t participate in the pairings.

As a class lead, I can “reset” at some point, after all potential pairs have been exhausted.

#### Consumable

#### Sports Team Matcher

**Roles**:
Player: Interested playing a team sport, able to search for a sports team by sport, age requirements, location, etc.

#### Hair Stylist app

A site where you can look for a hairdresser in your area. Hairdressers can post before and after pictures of their clients so that the user can see what kind of styles they cater to, and what kind of clientele they cater to. They can also list their base price such as $55+ for a cut, and something like $120+ for highlights, etc. Users can search by hairstyle, gender, and length. Users can post reviews of their stylist, users can make appointments with a stylist, users can search for stylists in their geographic area. Stylists can log-in to view their appointments as well.

#### Event Production app

An app so a company can display upcoming events, share photos/comments from past events, and share new music.  Potentially even include a blog or a retail section to their web-app.  This project would be incorporated with Facebook so that people can share when they are going to an event or comment on the event itself.  As well, the site can use jumbotrons to display upcoming artists that will be at their events and share their music along with links to their SoundCloud.  Last but not least, there could be a section for a blog where the administrator can upload content they want to stream to their end-user.

#### Life Habits app

A lifestyle tracker app using social media to monitor fitness and nutrition for someone who is looking to improve their every day life habits through tracking and being able to share their results among their friends to encourage each other. One idea of fitness tracking would be to monitor time and running distance through map functionality.

#### Recipe Collection app

A website where users can post or submit recipes, comment on recipes they've made.  Aside from comments, other users can leave recommendations and suggest 'substitutions' and 'additions' that worked for them. Users will keep accounts, each account will have a 'recipe box' - a place where they can keep recipes they liked.

### Suggestions from Elsewhere

[Mackenzie Child](https://mackenziechild.me/) has good suggestions for projects built using Rails.
In his [12 in 12](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/) project, he creates 12 apps in 12 weeks. There are video tutorials and examples of code you can use in order to follow along, step-by-step, with him.
The projects he builds are a Reddit Clone, a blog, a Recipe Box, a Pinterest Clone, a Movie Review App, a Todo App, a Jobs Board, a Workout Log, a Wikipedia Clone, a Forum, an Online Notebook App and a Dribbble Clone.
