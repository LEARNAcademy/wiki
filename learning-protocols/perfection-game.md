**Perfection Game**
------------

During code reviews and after you have given your tech talk, you might be invited to play the **Perfection Game**. The Perfection Game protocol will support you in your desire to aggregate the best ideas. Use it whenever you desire to improve something you’ve created.

#### Steps

- **Perfectee** performs an act or presents an object for perfection, optionally saying “Begin” and “End” to notify the **Perfector** of the start and end of the performance.
- **Perfector** rates the value of the performance or object on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how much value the **Perfector** believes he or she can add.
- **Perfector** says “What I liked about the performance or object was X,” and proceeds to list the qualities of the object the **Perfector** thought were of high quality or should be amplified.
- **Perfector** offers the improvements to the performance or object required for it to be rated a 10 by saying “To make it a ten, you would have to do X.”

#### Commitments

- Hold reasons for passing private.
- Pass on something as soon as you are aware you are going to pass.
- Respect the right of others to pass without explanation.
- Support those who pass by not discussing them or their pass.
- Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate or punish anyone who passes.
