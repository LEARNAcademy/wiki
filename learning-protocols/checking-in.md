**Check In**
------------
Every morning we will come together to do **Stand Up**.
This achieves many things:
- there is a definitive start to the day
- it engenders a sense of community and that we are learning together
- it is a chance listen to the successes and struggles that others in the groups are having with their learning and coding.

We use the **Check In Protocol**

# Steps

- Speaker says “I feel [one or more of **MAD**, **SAD**, **GLAD**, **AFRAID**].” Speaker may provide a brief explanation. Or if others have already checked in, the speaker may say **“I pass”**.
- Speaker says **“I’m in”**. This signifies that Speaker intends to behave according to the Code of Conduct at LEARN.
- Listeners respond, “Welcome.”

# Commitments

- State feelings without qualification.
- State feelings only as they pertain to yourself.
- Be silent during another’s Check In.
- Do not refer to another’s Check In disclosures without explicitly granted permission from him or her.

# Other thoughts

- All emotions are expressed through combinations of MAD, SAD, GLAD, or AFRAID. For example, “excited” may be a combination of GLAD and AFRAID.
- Check In as deeply as possible. Checking in with two or more emotions is the norm. The depth of a group’s Check In translates directly to the quality of the group’s results.
- Do not do anything to diminish your emotional state. Do not describe yourself as a “little” mad, sad, glad, or afraid or say “I’m mad, but I’m still glad.”
- Except in large groups, if more than one person checks in, it is recommended that all do so.
- HAPPY may be substituted for GLAD, and SCARED may be substituted for AFRAID.

**Pass Protocol**
------------
It was mentioned above that it is possible to use the **Pass Protocol**.
The **Pass Protocol** is how you decline to participate in something. Use it anytime you don’t want to participate in an activity.

# Steps

- When you’ve decided not to participate, say “I pass.”
- **Unpass** any time you desire. **Unpass** as soon as you know you want to participate again by saying “I unpass.”

# Commitments

- Hold reasons for passing private.
- Pass on something as soon as you are aware you are going to pass.
- Respect the right of others to pass without explanation.
- Support those who pass by not discussing them or their pass.
- Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate or punish anyone who passes.

# Notes

- In general, you will not be in good standing with your Core Commitments if you pass most of the time.
- You can pass on any activity; however, if you have adopted the Core Commitments, you cannot pass on a Decider vote and you must say “I’m in” when checking in.
- You can pass even though you have already started something.
