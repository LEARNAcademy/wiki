**The School Day**

----------------

Class time will be 9:15am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. The space is open from 8.30am and there is generally someone around after class ends at 5:00pm if you wanted to spend time working on your projects.
We'll have standup review at 9:15 sharp every morning, so allow yourself the time you need to be ready at LEARN by that time.
You can generally park on the street on the two or three blocks away from the LEARN classroom without too much trouble. There are many sections of the neighborhood that have 2-hour parking, so just be aware of that. In fact, the west side of Ray St, south of North Park Way, has 2-hour zones, whereas the east side is all-day parking.

Here's an example of a Typical Day at LEARN Academy

We may also have visitors to the classroom from time to time, who will speak on a range of subjects from Staying Healthy At Your Desk to Fundamentals of Design. We also invite the partner companies to speak about what they do and what to expect during their internships. All these typically happen in the middle of the afternoon.

An instructor will organize a weekly one-on-one check-in to review the week. This usually takes between 15 to 20 minutes. It's an opportunity to take stock of what you have done so far, review your progress, celebrate successes and, because the check-in takes place on a walk around the neighborhood, it is also a chance to take a break from programming and breathe some fresh air. These check-ins generally happen towards the end of the day so as not to interrupt important demos or input.
