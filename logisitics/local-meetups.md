**Local Meet-Ups**

---------------

When looking for your first position as a junior web developer, one of the best ways to get noticed is to be active within the local tech community.  
San Diego has a very active meetup scene. [SD Tech Scene](http://sdtechscene.org/) is the best way to keep up with what is going on.  
Below are some that might be of particular interest to us here...  

- [SD Ruby](http://www.sdruby.org/) Held monthly on the first Thursday at the CS Building at UCSD
- [SD Ruby & Rails Study Group Magic Night](http://www.sdruby.org/) Held monthly on the last Thursday here at Learn SD
- [San Diego JS Meetup Group](http://sandiegojs.org) Held monthly on the first Tuesday at 3rdSpace in University Heights
