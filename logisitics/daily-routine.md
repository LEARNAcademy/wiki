**Co-Working Spaces**

-----------------

Class will be 9.15am to 5pm, Monday through Friday, except on some public holidays. There will be staff on site from 8.30am each day, so you are more than welcome to work on projects before class starts. We are part of the Union Cowork space, so there might be opportunity to be there even earlier than that.

We'll have stand-up at 9:15 sharp every morning. This is a gathering of the class and staff to share thoughts and instill a sense of togetherness in our learning.

Lunch is usually at 12 noon, this can sometimes move depending on the availability of speakers that we invite to LEARN academy. There is a fridge and a microwave if you want to bring a packed lunch from home. 

Class ends at 5pm. There is usually staff on hand if you wanted to work beyond that time. Often there are events hosted at our space after class which you may find interesting and you are more than welcome to attend, as well as free yoga on Wednesdays after class which is a great way to unwind after a hard day in front of a monitor.

We are based at 704, J St, in the East Village of San Diegoâ€™s downtown. Very close to the ballpark. The closest bus stop is at Broadway and 8th were the #8, #20 and #30 all stop.
